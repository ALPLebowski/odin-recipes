   <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Turn your weeknight dinner into a fancy affair 
        with this easy pork tenderloin recipe.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
     <ul>
      <li>1 pound pork tenderloin</li>
      <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
      <li>1 bunch fresh sage, leaves removed and stems discarded, divided</li>
      <li>6 ounces prosciutto</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon olive oil, or more as needed</li>
     </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
     <ol>
      <li>Step</li>
      <p>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</p>
      <li>Step</li>
      <p>Lightly season pork with salt and black pepper. 
         Arrange about 6 sage leaves over tenderloin. 
         Wrap prosciutto around tenderloin and sage, 
         overlapping prosciutto slightly; 
         wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate 
         to allow prosciutto to set on pork tenderloin, 5 to 10 minutes. 
         Remove plastic wrap.</p>
      <li>Step</li>
      <p>Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. 
         Fry wrapped tenderloin in the hot oil 
         until prosciutto is crispy and lightly browned on all sides, 
         8 to 10 minutes. Transfer wrapped tenderloin to a baking dish, 
         reserving oil in the skillet.</p>
      <li>Step</li>
      <p>Bake tenderloin in the preheated oven until pork is cooked through, 
         about 20 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted 
         into the center should read at least 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).</p>
      <li>Step</li>
      <p>Heat reserved oil in the skillet over medium heat; 
         fry remaining sage leaves until crispy, 
         adding more oil as needed, about 5 minutes.</p>
      <li>Step</li>
      <p>Slice tenderloin and serve with crispy sage leaves.</p>
     </ol>
